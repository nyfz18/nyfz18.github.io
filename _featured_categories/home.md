## Introduction

  Hi, my name is Nina Zhang and I'm currently working as a software engineer at Harvard University. I'm a graduate of Brandeis University ('24), with a dual degree in computer science and biology. Previously, I was a Health Policy & Data Intern at Massachusetts General Hospital where I worked on a [[COVID-19 outbreak simulator](https://www.covid19sim.org/)] that predicted trends in communities across the nation.

## Motivation and Main Principle: 
  My academic interests primarily lies in artificial intelligence (AI) and its governance, driven by a commitment to protecting the core values that define our humanity. As we advance our technological capabilities, I believe we must work as equally hard -- if not, more -- to uphold our ethical, social, and our intellectual responsibilities.
